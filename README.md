### What is it?

Mineflayer-StateMachine is a plugin for Mineflayer. It aims to add a flexible and customizable state machine API on top of Mineflayer to make it easier to write and scale bots.

Writing a complex bot AI can be difficult, especially if it has to be convincing. Finite state machines make this process much eaiser by offloading the fine details into isolated modules which only serve a single function or behavior. These modules can then be connected together in a top level component to customize how these seperate modules should interact and pass around control of the bot and state machine parameters.

### Getting Started

This plugin is built using Node and can be installed using:
```bash
npm install --save mineflayer-statemachine
```

This plugin relies on [mineflayer-pathfinder](https://github.com/Karang/mineflayer-pathfinder) for movement related behaviors. If these behaviors are used, this plugin must be loaded before starting the state machine object.

### Simple Bot

The API for Mineflayer-StateMachine aims to be simple and intuitive, requiring minimal effort to setup a working state machine. The example below creates a three-state finite state machine which finds and follows the nearest player, stopping and looking at them when they are close.

```js
// Create your bot
const mineflayer = require("mineflayer");
const bot = mineflayer.createBot({ username: "Player" });

// Load your dependency plugins.
bot.loadPlugin(require('mineflayer-pathfinder').pathfinder);

// Import required structures.
const { BotStateMachine, buildTransition, buildNestedMachineArgs } = require('@nxg-org/mineflayer-statemachine') 

// Import required behaviors.
// Note: Rename behaviors by import schema here.
const {
    BehaviorFindEntity: FindEntity,
    BehaviorFollowEntity: FollowTarget,
    BehaviorLookAtEntity: LookAtTarget
} = require('mineflayer-statemachine/lib/behaviors')

// Util function to find the nearest player.
const nearestPlayer = (e) => e.type === 'player'

const transitions = [

    // We want to start following the player immediately after finding them.
    // Since BehaviorFindEntity finishes instantly, we will transition almost immediately.
    buildTransition('findToFollow', FindEntity, FollowTarget)
        .setShouldTransition(state => state.foundEntity()),
    
    // If the distance to the player is less than two blocks, switch from the followPlayer
    // state to the lookAtPlayer state.
    buildTransition('followToLook', FollowTarget, LookAtTarget)
        .setShouldTransition(state => state.distanceToTarget() < 2),

    // If the distance to the player is more than two blocks, switch from the lookAtPlayer
    // state to the followPlayer state.
    buildTransition('lookToFollow', LookAtTarget, FollowTarget)
        .setShouldTransition(state => state.distanceToTarget() >= 2)
]

// Now we just wrap our transition list in a nested state machine layer. We want the bot
// to start on the getClosestPlayer state, so we'll specify that here.
// We can specify entry arguments to our entry class here as well.
const root = buildNestedMachineArgs('rootLayer', transitions, FindEntity, [nearestPlayer])

// We can start our state machine simply by creating a new instance.
// We can delay the start of our machine by using autoStart: false
const machine = new BotStateMachine({bot, root, autoStart: false});

// Start the machine anytime using BotStateMachine.start()
bot.once('spawn', () => machine.start())
```
